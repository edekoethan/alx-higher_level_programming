SUMMARY OF PYTHON STRINGS
Python strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). Here are some key points to summarize Python strings:

Creation: Strings can be created using quotes ('' or "") around the characters, such as "Hello" or 'Python'.

Immutability: Strings in Python are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created. However, operations on strings can produce new strings.

Indexing: Each character in a string has an index, starting from 0 for the first character. Indexing allows accessing individual characters using square brackets ([]).

Slicing: Strings can be sliced to extract substrings using a start index, end index, and optional step value. Slicing is performed using the syntax string[start:end:step].

Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator or by simply placing them side by side. For example, "Hello, " + "Python!" or "Hello, " "Python!".

Length: The len() function can be used to determine the length of a string, which represents the number of characters it contains.

String methods: Python provides various built-in methods for working with strings, such as lower(), upper(), strip(), split(), join(), and many more. These methods enable operations like converting case, removing whitespace, splitting into substrings, and joining strings together.

Escape sequences: Backslashes () are used to escape special characters within strings. For example, "\n" represents a newline character, and "\t" represents a tab character.

String formatting: Python offers multiple ways to format strings, including the % operator, the str.format() method, and f-strings (formatted string literals). These allow you to incorporate variables and expressions within strings.

Strings are a fundamental data type in Python, and understanding their properties and various operations is essential for working effectively with text-based data and building robust applications.


PROJECT TASKS

mandatory
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE

2. Hello, print
mandatory
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function print


3. Print integer
mandatory
Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.


4. Print float
mandatory
Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

5. Print string
mandatory
Complete this source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

6. Play with strings
mandatory
Complete this source code to print Welcome to Holberton School!


7. Copy - Cut - Paste
mandatory
Complete this source code

You can find the source code here
You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
word_first_3 should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
word_last_2 should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
middle_word should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letter

8. Create a new sentence

Your script should be maximum 98 characters long (please check with wc -m 9-easter_egg.py


10. Linked list cycle
mandatory
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle
Requirements:

Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free


ADVANCED

11. Hello, write
#advanced
Write a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.

Use the function write from the sys module
You are not allowed to use print
Your script should print to stderr
Your script should exit with the status code 1

12. Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE

The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)
